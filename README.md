# Go Sailing!

Go Sailing is a tiny sailing simulator.

The race course is set up with the windward mark at the top of the screen and boat at the bottom of the screen.
Port and starboard laylines are displayed for both the boat and the mark. Boat is moving at a constant speed
and always tacks at a 90 degree angle.

Use windshifts to your advantage and nail the layline!

## Requirements

Go 1.23 was used during development, though any fairly recent version should do as well. 
[Pixel2](https://github.com/gopxl/pixel) graphics library is used for rendering.

## Running it

```bash
go run ./cmd/gosailing
```
